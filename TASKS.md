# Chicago Shia League - Tasks & Issues

## üî¥ CRITICAL - Fix Immediately

### 1. Homepage Not Loading Firebase Data
**File:** `index.html`

**Problem:** Homepage shows static hardcoded games instead of loading from Firebase.

**Current State:** 
- Console shows: "Homepage loaded with static data" 
- Static game cards are hardcoded in HTML
- `home.js` script is not being loaded or executed

**Solution:**
1. Add `<script src="js/home.js"></script>` before `</body>` in `index.html`
2. Verify Firebase SDK scripts load before `home.js`
3. Ensure `gamesContainer` ID exists in HTML
4. Test that games from Firestore appear on page

**Expected Behavior:**
- Homepage loads games from Firestore for current season/week
- Shows real team names and scores from database
- Displays game leaders (points, rebounds, blocks, steals)
- Updates automatically when new games are added

---

### 2. Admin Player Stats Form Disappears
**File:** `admin.html`, `js/admin.js`

**Problem:** After creating a game, if user switches tabs, the player stats form disappears and can't add more stats to that game.

**Current State:**
- Create game ‚Üí form appears
- Switch to different tab ‚Üí form gone
- No way to add more player stats later
- `currentGameId` variable gets lost

**Solution Options:**

**Option A: Persist currentGameId across tab switches**
```javascript
// In admin.js - save gameId when created
function switchTab(tabName) {
    // Don't reset currentGameId
    // Keep player stats form visible if game exists
    if (currentGameId && tabName === 'addGame') {
        document.getElementById('playerStatsSection').classList.remove('hidden');
        loadPlayersForGame(currentGameId);
    }
}
```

**Option B( I Want this): Add "Add Stats to Existing Game" feature** 
- Dropdown to select existing games
- Load players from those teams
- Add stats to any game retroactively

**Option C: Show warning before switching**
- Alert user: "You have an active game. Add all player stats before switching tabs."
- Confirm before switching

**Recommended:** Implement Option B for best user experience

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Soon

### 3. Create Games by Week Page
**File:** `games.html` (DOES NOT EXIST)

**Requirements:**
- Show all games organized by week
- Week selector (dropdown or tabs for Week 1, 2, 3, etc.)
- Display game cards similar to homepage
- Show game date, teams, scores, leaders
- Filter by season
- Mobile responsive

**Similar To:** Homepage, but shows all past weeks not just current

---

### 4. Add Edit/Delete Functionality
**Files:** `admin.html`, `js/admin.js`

**Missing Features:**
- Cannot edit existing games
- Cannot delete games through UI
- Cannot edit player stats
- Cannot delete player stats
- Cannot edit teams/players after creation

**Solution:**
Add fourth tab: "Manage Existing Data"
- Dropdown to select game ‚Üí Edit button
- Show all player stats ‚Üí Edit/Delete buttons
- List all teams ‚Üí Edit/Delete buttons
- List all players ‚Üí Edit/Delete buttons

---

### 5. Data Validation
**Files:** All forms in `admin.html`

**Missing Validations:**
- FG Made can exceed FG Attempted (shouldn't be possible)
- 2PT + 3PT should equal FG (currently not checked)
- Points should equal (2PT√ó2 + 3PT√ó3 + FT) (not validated)
- Negative numbers allowed
- Team can play against itself
- Same player can be added to game multiple times

**Solution:** Add validation in `admin.js` before saving:
```javascript
// Example validation
if (fgMade > fgAtt) {
    alert('FG Made cannot exceed FG Attempted');
    return;
}

const calculatedFG = twoMade + threeMade;
if (fgMade !== calculatedFG) {
    alert('FG Made must equal 2PT Made + 3PT Made');
    return;
}
```

  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Anyone can read
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
    
    // Only authenticated admins can write
    match /teams/{teamId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /players/{playerId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /games/{gameId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    match /gameStats/{statId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Only specific admin can edit settings
    match /settings/{settingId} {
      allow write: if request.auth != null &&

**Severity:** Low  
**Issue:** "An element doesn't have an autocomplete attribute"
